# songs

In this implementation, the Song class represents a node in a linked list, with each song having a name, a prev pointer to the previous song in the list, and a next pointer to the next song in the list.

The RecentlyPlayedSongs class represents the store, with the capacity determining the maximum number of songs that can be stored per user. The songMap is a Map that links each user to their most recently played song, and the head and tail pointers keep track of the front and end of the linked list.
